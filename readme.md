This is the backend of the clone project of a freecodecamp.org tutorial which can be found in this following link
----> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_u6P5k0vP0
Issues:
Was unable to use remote server 
Triggers were not working for some reasons
after failing to implement the trigger functionalites I quitted creating the rest of backend side and focused on frontend
so I should come back here again one day to fix this issue and complete the project
